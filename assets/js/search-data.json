A comparison of the rating vs asking price of houses are shown below, along with their current status and area. Click the corresponding unit in the legend to remove houses from the plot. . . . Plot: Price Change since 2019 . The median increase in asking price relative to 2019 is 40%. Houses below this median are depicted in the green area of the plot, while houses above this are depicted in the red area of the plot. . . . What are our ratings sensitive to? Rating, Price and Square Footage . Our average house rating grows less than linearly with the increase in square footage. . There are several houses with an average rating &gt; 7 beyond 3500 square feet. | . . . The following shows that we are mostly insensitive to price after the square footage of the house is accounted for (with 0.3 change in average rating per 100 increase in price/sqft): . . . . . Historical Prices in the OC Areas . Below are shown the historical prices of houses in each area relative to their estimated price in 2000. The final points in 2021 are based on average asking price per area of the houses we have noted. . Methodology . Historical prices are taken from the Federal Housing Finance Agency&#39;s House Price Index (HPI 2000). This gives the measure $hpi _2000(X)$ for any year $X$ in any zip code. The 2021 points are calculated as follows: . hpi_2000(2021) $ equiv$ hpi_2000(2019) * ( 1 + $ langle frac{zillow _asking(house_i)}{zillow _2019(house_i)} rangle_{i in area})$ . . . The sharp rise in 2021 is confirmed by a recent FHFA report for 2021 Q3. . Historical Data on houses sold from OCRE . The Orange County Real Estate Inc provides access to some data, about 2k homes sold in the last 3 years in the specific regions of OC that we have been looking at. . . . Within the price range of 750k to 2M, the average price across all areas here has increase from 1.35M (Aug 2019) to 1.7M (Jan 2021) | This is easier to see by deselecting all areas in the legend (double click a single one to select only that area; then single click to deselect that area as well) | . . . The average selling price went from 97% of list (Jul 2019) to 104% of list (Jan 2022) | This is easier to see by deselecting all areas in the legend (double click a single one to select only that area; then single click to deselect that area as well) | . CA Monthly Median Owner (Mortgage) Cost . What are the typical costs that people in OC pay for their mortgage? We can use data from the American Community Survey (search median mortgage) to look at this, though it only goes up to 2019. . . . Note: Values that exceed $4,000 are reported in the data as &quot;4,000+&quot;. They have been replaced with 4000.1 in the data above. This occurs for some areas of Irvine (92603 for 2011,2012,2014), Ladera Ranch/Mission Viejo (92694 for 2011, 2019). The estimates for these places/years may be much higher than shown in the plot. | The takeaway is that mortgage costs are: Ranked fairly stable across areas (high ranked areas remain high consistently) | Dropped to a low in 2015 and return to 2011 levels in 2019. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t yet see beyond 2019 with this data, though for 2021 onward, we can impute a 40% increase in mortgage costs over 2019. | . | .",
